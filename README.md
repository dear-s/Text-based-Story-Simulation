- Deployed the Unity WebGL at https://simmer.io/@sanya638/wonder-town Go ahead and immerse yourself in this simple storytelling ride!!

- This story telling is all about making them aware about the outbreak of covid, how he learn about it and the urge to help or in this case 'get face masks'.

- We tried to give emphasis on how users are handling their relationships with older people as they have greater risks of getting hospitalization or dying if they are diagnosed with covid.

- People are suffering with social isolation and mostly seniors are the one at a significant risk of getting covid. This game ask about your opinion, what did you understand, how will you react in such a case and we provide response as well.

- Users need to understand if their choice is acceptable or not. The goal is to help them prepare with the real-life motivational stories and get them prepared.
